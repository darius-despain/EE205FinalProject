# EE205FinalProject

Members: Tyler Butuyan, Darius DeSpain, Kona Canaday
## Background
This program is our final project for EE 205: Object Oriented Programming (Spring 2017) at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. It utilizes our knowledge gained over the semester in C++ to make a fun program centered around objects.

## Overview
The game is based on the Japanese handheld pet game "Tamagotchi". This game creates a virtual pet upon startup and has different stats, then according to different user inputs the pet will continue to grow or die. The user can perform many different functions including sleep, feed, clean, and play where each function will affect the stats of the pet based on the outcome of the function.

## Driver
The driver combines all of the classes and runs all the checks for each phase then performs actions as necessary. This driver looks fairly lengthy for just combining classes because it takes user input and calls each class's functions depending on user input and the status of the tamagotchi at the time. The game cycles through the evolutions and eventually the Tamagotchi will die of old age or of the user not taking care of it. 

## Display
To display the program, we 'drew' the Tamagotchi in its different phases, which we represented by classes. You can see the text files are a series of dashes and symbols to 'draw' the Tamagotchi in its different phases. We then just display these text files along with a prompt for options the user has in the next step of the game.

## Reflection
This project was one of our first times using an object oriented language and our first time utilizing objects to store data. From this project we learned that objects are a concise way of storing similar, related information that can be accessed easily and makes coding and understanding a program much easier.
